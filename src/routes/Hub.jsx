      title: "Added Collectr-Style Portfolio with Collection Tracking and Market Data Integration",
      description: "Implemented a comprehensive Portfolio section that provides Collectr-style collection tracking and portfolio management. The new Portfolio feature includes three main tabs: Overview (portfolio metrics and recent activity), Collection (visual grid of owned items with real product images and market data), and Trends (monthly trends and top performing items). Integrated with the existing Price Charting API to fetch real-time market prices, product images, and set information for all portfolio items. The system automatically calculates portfolio value, profit/loss, and performance metrics using live market data. Added Portfolio card to the Hub page and navigation links in the sidebar. The Portfolio provides a complete view of collection value, individual item performance, and market trends, making it easy to track investment performance and collection growth over time.",

      description: "Fixed an issue where selecting products from the search dropdown in the OrderBook was only saving the base product name (e.g., 'Elite Trainer Box') instead of the full name with set information (e.g., 'Elite Trainer Box - Pokemon Journey Together'). Updated the handleProductSelect function in OrderBook.jsx to match the logic used in QuickAdd.jsx, ensuring that when a product is selected, it creates a display name that includes set information if available. This ensures consistency across both QuickAdd and OrderBook components, so users get the complete product name with set details when selecting items from the search dropdown.",

This ensures that searches like 'Elite Trainer Box Black Bolt' will now properly rank 'Elite Trainer Box - Pokemon Black Bolt' at the top instead of showing Elite Trainer Boxes from other sets first. The algorithm now gives higher priority to set-specific matches, making it much easier to find products from specific Pokemon sets.",

      description: "Added database-level unique constraints to prevent true duplicate orders while preserving the ability to sell the same item multiple times legitimately. Created a unique index on the orders table that prevents identical orders (same item, order date, retailer, marketplace, buy price, and user) from being inserted at the database level. This approach is superior to application-level checking because it prevents accidental duplicates (like double-clicking save) while still allowing legitimate multiple sales of the same item on the same day. The database constraint ensures data integrity without interfering with normal business operations where users might sell multiple copies of the same product. A SQL migration script (add-orders-unique-constraints.sql) has been created for easy deployment.",

When searching 'sealed prismatic evolutions', the search was correctly filtering to show only sealed products but was losing the ranking priority that puts Prismatic Evolutions products at the top. Implemented intelligent search query cleaning that removes 'sealed' from the search terms for better matching while still applying the sealed filter. Added fallback broad search functionality that activates when too few sealed results are found, ensuring users can always find relevant sealed products. Now searches like 'sealed prismatic evolutions' will show Elite Trainer Boxes, Booster Bundles, and other sealed products from the Prismatic Evolutions set at the top of results, followed by other sealed products in order of relevance.",

This ensures only actual sealed products like booster boxes, bundles, and collections get the green 'Sealed' indicator. (2) Added intelligent search filtering - when users include 'sealed' in their search query (regardless of capitalization), the search now automatically filters to show only sealed products, making it much easier to find boxes, bundles, and collections when specifically looking for sealed items. Both improvements work together to provide more accurate product categorization and better search targeting.",

Added priority boosting to similarity scores so exact matches always appear at the top of search results. This fixes issues where searching for specific terms like 'Elite trainer box prismatic' would show generic Elite Trainer Boxes from other sets before the actual Prismatic Evolutions Elite Trainer Box.

Added 'Show More' functionality that displays the first 20 results initially with an option to expand and see all results (up to 100). This addresses the limitation where searching for complete sets like 'Pokemon Prismatic Evolutions' (which has 493 items) would only show a small fraction of available products.

The status bar shows whether the API is online or offline with a colored indicator (green for online, red for offline) and displays the last time data was successfully synced. The system automatically checks API health every 6 hours in the background without user intervention. Updates the last sync timestamp whenever price updates, bulk updates, or sync operations complete successfully. This provides users with immediate visibility into data connectivity and freshness without technical jargon or manual refresh requirements.",

Removed the complex conditional rendering logic that was preventing multiple cards from being visible simultaneously. Now when adding new items to any category (Products, Retailers, Marketplaces, Pokemon Cards, Video Games, Magic Cards, Yu-Gi-Oh Cards), only the selected card shows its form while all other cards remain visible in their collapsed state. This provides a much better user experience and allows users to see all available categories at once.",

      description: "Removed the logo image from all header components to create a cleaner, more minimal brand presentation. Adjusted the BETA badge positioning by increasing the bottom margin from mb-0.5 to mb-1 to better align with the OneTrack title baseline. This creates a more refined and focused header design that emphasizes the typography while maintaining the subtle BETA status indication.",

      title: "Reduced BETA Badge Text Size for Subtle Branding",
      description: "Made the BETA badge text smaller (changed from text-sm to text-xs) while maintaining its perfect positioning on the bottom baseline nearly touching the OneTrack title. This creates a more subtle and refined appearance that clearly indicates the beta status without overwhelming the main brand name. The smaller size makes the BETA badge feel more like a natural typographic element while preserving the precise alignment and spacing that was previously achieved.",

      description: "Further refined the BETA badge positioning to achieve perfect visual alignment. Moved the BETA text even closer to the OneTrack title using negative left margin (-ml-1) so it's nearly touching, and adjusted the vertical position (mb-0.5) to perfectly align with the bottom baseline of the title text. This creates the most precise and professional typography alignment possible, ensuring the BETA badge appears as a natural extension of the OneTrack brand name.",

The BETA text now sits lower and closer to the title, creating a more cohesive and professional appearance. This refinement enhances the overall visual hierarchy and brand presentation across all pages.",
